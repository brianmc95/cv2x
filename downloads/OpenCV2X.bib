  abstract={In this work the authors present the first publicly available, open-source simulation model of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 14 Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) standard. The model specifically addresses Mode 4, in which vehicles communicate directly in peer to peer mode using a distributed resource allocation algorithm. Importantly, the model is fully compliant with existing service and application layers already defined by the automotive and standards communities, providing a fully standardised cross-layer communication model spanning application layer based on the ITS-G5 standard to physical layer from the new C-V2X Mode 4 standard. This enables enhancements of the lower layers to support future vehicular use cases. The simulation model has been implemented by extending SimuLTE, an OMNeT++ cellular communication stack that enables simulation of LTE networks as well as extending and integrating Artery, an ETSI compliant ITS-G5 implementation. The developed model is validated using published 3GPP simulation evaluation scenarios and is available at www.cs.ucc.ie/cv2x.},
